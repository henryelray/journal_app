# journal_app
A web app that allows users to log journals relating to specific topics of interest
This project is a clone of a learning_log app built by Eric Matthes in his Python Crash Course Book.
I took this project after reading the book in order to understand the basics of the Django web framework and CRUD operations.

Features of this App.

- Users can sign up for an account
- Login feature
- Users can create a topic and an entry
- Users can edit an entry
- Users can delete
